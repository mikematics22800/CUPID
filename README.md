# Welcome to your Expo app ðŸ‘‹

This is an [Expo](https://expo.dev) project created with [`create-expo-app`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/create-expo-app).

## Get started

1. Install dependencies

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Set up environment variables

   Create a `.env` file in the root directory with your Supabase credentials and Gemini API key:
   ```
   EXPO_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_url
   EXPO_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_KEY=your_supabase_anon_key
   SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=your_supabase_service_role_key
   EXPO_PUBLIC_GEMINI_KEY=your_gemini_api_key_here
   ```

   **To get your Gemini API key:**
   - Go to [Google AI Studio](https://makersuite.google.com/app/apikey)
   - Sign in with your Google account
   - Click "Create API Key"
   - Copy the generated key and paste it in your `.env` file

3. Set up Supabase storage for photo uploads

   ```bash
   npm run setup-storage
   ```

4. Start the app

   ```bash
   npx expo start
   ```

In the output, you'll find options to open the app in a

- [development build](https://docs.expo.dev/develop/development-builds/introduction/)
- [Android emulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/android-studio-emulator/)
- [iOS simulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/ios-simulator/)
- [Expo Go](https://expo.dev/go), a limited sandbox for trying out app development with Expo

You can start developing by editing the files inside the **app** directory. This project uses [file-based routing](https://docs.expo.dev/router/introduction).

## Photo Upload Feature

The app now requires users to upload at least 5 photos before they can register. Here's how it works:

### Features:
- **Photo Selection**: Users can select photos from their device gallery
- **Photo Preview**: Selected photos are displayed in a grid with numbered indicators
- **Photo Removal**: Users can remove individual photos by tapping the X button
- **Photo Counter**: Shows current photo count (X/5) with a warning if less than 5
- **Upload Progress**: Shows "Uploading Photos..." during the registration process
- **Storage Integration**: Photos are uploaded to Supabase storage and URLs are stored in the user profile

### Technical Details:
- Photos are stored in Supabase storage bucket `users`
- Each user gets their own folder: `users/{user_id}/`
- Photos are automatically resized to 1:1 aspect ratio for consistency
- Maximum file size: 50MB per photo
- Supported formats: JPEG, PNG, WebP
- Photo URLs are generated dynamically from storage, not stored in database

### Database Schema:
The `users` table should contain basic profile information (name, bio, birthday, etc.) but does not need a `photos` column since photos are managed entirely through Supabase storage.

## AI Bio Generation Feature

The app now includes an AI-powered bio generation feature that helps users create engaging dating app bios based on their interests and hobbies.

### Features:
- **Interest Selection**: Users can select from 5 categories of interests and hobbies:
  - Sports & Fitness (Running, Gym, Yoga, etc.)
  - Arts & Culture (Photography, Music, Travel, etc.)
  - Technology & Gaming (Programming, Gaming, AI/ML, etc.)
  - Nature & Outdoors (Camping, Hiking, Gardening, etc.)
  - Social & Lifestyle (Networking, Volunteering, Foodie, etc.)
- **Multi-Selection**: Users can select multiple interests across different categories
- **AI Bio Generation**: Uses Google's Gemini AI to generate personalized bio suggestions
- **Character Limit**: Generated bios are kept under 150 characters for optimal dating app performance
- **One-Click Integration**: Generated bios are automatically added to the bio text field

### How to Use:
1. Navigate to the Profile screen
2. Tap the "AI Bio Generator" button in the About Me section
3. Select your interests and hobbies from the available categories
4. Tap "Generate Bio Suggestion"
5. The AI will create a personalized bio based on your selections
6. The generated bio will be automatically added to your bio text field

### Technical Details:
- Uses Google's Gemini 2.0 Flash model via direct API calls for React Native compatibility
- Interests are categorized for better organization and user experience
- The AI prompt is optimized for dating app context and character limits
- Error handling includes network connectivity checks and user-friendly error messages

## Get a fresh project

When you're ready, run:

```bash
npm run reset-project
```

This command will move the starter code to the **app-example** directory and create a blank **app** directory where you can start developing.
