# Dual Verification System Guide

## Overview

The CUPID app now requires **both email and phone verification** during registration. Users can no longer register with separate methods - both email and phone number are required simultaneously.

## Key Changes Made

### 1. **Registration Process**
- **Before**: Users could register with email only
- **Now**: Users must provide both email AND phone number during registration
- Both verification codes are sent simultaneously during registration

### 2. **Login Process**
- **Before**: Separate login options for email and phone
- **Now**: Email login only (since both are verified during registration)
- Phone login option removed from login screen

### 3. **Verification Flow**
- **New**: Dual verification screen that requires both email and phone codes
- Users must enter both 6-digit verification codes
- Both codes must be verified before account activation

## User Flow

### Registration Flow:
1. User fills out registration form (including both email and phone)

6. Upon successful verification, user is redirected to login screen

### Login Flow:
1. User enters email and password
2. System authenticates user (both email and phone already verified)
3. User is logged in and redirected to main app

## Benefits

## Error Handling

### Registration Errors:

- **Network errors**: Retry suggestions

### Verification Errors:

- **Invalid phone code**: Resend functionality
- **Partial verification**: Clear guidance on what's missing

## Configuration Requirements

### Supabase Settings:
- **SMS Provider**: Must be configured (Twilio recommended)
- **Email Provider**: Default Supabase email service
- **Phone Number Format**: International format required (+1 for US)

### Twilio Setup:
- **Account SID** and **Auth Token** in Supabase dashboard

- **Credits** in Twilio account for SMS sending

## Testing

### Test Scenarios:
1. **Valid registration** with both email and phone
2. **Invalid phone number** format
3. **Duplicate email** registration
4. **Duplicate phone** registration
5. **SMS service unavailable** (Twilio errors)
6. **Partial verification** (only email or only phone)
7. **Login after successful verification**

### Test Data:
- Use real email addresses for testing
- Use real phone numbers for SMS testing
- Test with various phone number formats

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:

1. **"SMS service unavailable"**
   - Check Twilio configuration in Supabase
   - Verify Twilio account has credits
   - Check phone number format

2. **"Phone number already exists"**
   - User already registered with this phone
   - Suggest using different phone number

3. **"Email already exists"**
   - User already registered with this email
   - Suggest using different email

4. **Verification codes not received**
   - Check spam/junk folders for email
   - Check SMS delivery status
   - Use resend functionality

## Future Enhancements

### Potential Improvements:
1. **SMS fallback** - email-only registration if SMS fails
2. **Voice call verification** - alternative to SMS
3. **Social login integration** - Google/Facebook with phone verification
4. **Progressive verification** - verify one method first, then the other
5. **Verification reminders** - follow-up emails/SMS for unverified users

## Migration Notes

### For Existing Users:
- Existing users with only email verification will need to add phone
- Consider migration strategy for existing accounts
- May need to prompt existing users to add phone number

### For Development:
- Test thoroughly with both email and phone verification
- Ensure proper error handling for all scenarios
- Monitor SMS delivery rates and costs
